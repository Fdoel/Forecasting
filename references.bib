abstract = {This article discusses filtering, prediction and simulation in univariate and multivariate noncausal processes. A closed-form functional estimator of the predictive density for noncausal and mixed processes is introduced that provides prediction intervals up to a finite horizon H. A state-space representation of a noncausal and mixed multivariate vector autoregressive process is derived in two ways-by the partial fraction decomposition or from the real Jordan canonical form. A recursive BHHH algorithm for the maximization of the approximate log-likelihood function is proposed, which calculates the filtered values of the unobserved causal and noncausal components of the process. The new methods are illustrated by a simulation study involving a univariate noncausal process with infinite variance.},

title = "Simulation, Estimation and Selection of Mixed Causal-Noncausal Autoregressive Models: The MARX Package",
abstract = "This paper presents the MARX package for the analysis of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes with possibly exogenous regressors. The distinctive feature of MARX models is that they abandon the Gaussianity assumption on the error term.This deviation from the Box-Jenkins approach allows researchers to distinguish backward (causal) and forward-looking (noncausal) stationary behavior in time series (see e.g. Hecq et al., 2016, for an overview). The MARX package offers functions to simulate, estimate and select mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive models, possibly including exogenous regressors. The procedures for this are discussed in Hecq et al. (2016) for the MAR, and Hecq et al. (2017) for the MARX respectively. ",

abstract = {Theoretical results and empirical evidences indicate that the Ljung–Box test is sensitive to the number of lags (H) involved in the test. In time series literature, different values are suggested for H. This paper is concerned with the selecting optimal number of lags H in Ljung–Box test such that the actual size of the test does not exceed the test’s level while the power of the test does not fall under specific value. A simulation study is employed to investigate the effect of selecting an improper values of H on the actual size and power of the Ljung–Box test. The results confirm that an optimal value of H depends on the time series’ length as well as the test’s level. The comparison results with currently used approaches in the literature confirm that the commonly used techniques are not suggesting a proper value for H.}

 abstract = {In this paper we investigate the multi-period forecast performance of a number of empirical self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) models that have been proposed in the literature for modelling exchange rates and GNP, among other variables. We take each of the empirical SETAR models in turn as the DGP to ensure that the 'non-linearity' characterizes the future, and compare the forecast performance of SETAR and linear autoregressive models on a number of quantitative and qualitative criteria. Our results indicate that non-linear models have an edge in certain states of nature but not in others, and that this can be highlighted by evaluating forecasts conditional upon the regime.},
