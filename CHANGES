1. Removed line breaks for else and if else statments that caused erros
2. changed instances of x != "not" and x == "not" to !identical(x, "not") and identical(x, "not")
3. Added the MART.R functions which are all adjusted version of their counterparts in MARX_functions.R. Changes have been made to the residuals, regressors matrices etc. to make them work with threshold models
